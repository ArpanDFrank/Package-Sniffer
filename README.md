# Package-Sniffer
This project focuses on utilizing a Raspberry Pi to perform ethical hacking tasks related to WiFi network security. The
Raspberry Pi is employed to analyze vulnerabilities in wireless networks by capturing and analyzing packet data. Key
activities include snifng network packets, capturing WPA handshake fles, and conducting password cracking attempts
to assess the security of WiFi networks. By demonstrating the process of extracting and analyzing 4-way WPA
handshakes, the project highlights the potential security risks inherent in WiFi networks and underscores the importance
of implementing robust security measures to protect wireless infrastructures.
